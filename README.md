# Weather App in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose

This Weather App is an Android application that provides real-time weather information by fetching data from a weather API. Built using Jetpack Compose for a modern UI, the app showcases efficient API integration and clean architecture practices.

## Features:
- **Jetpack Compose:** The app leverages *Jetpack Compose*, a modern Android UI toolkit, to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
- **Kotlin:** Developed entirely in *Kotlin*, the codebase benefits from the conciseness and expressiveness of the language, promoting efficient and readable code.
- **Retrofit:** Fetches news articles from an API.
- **Moshi:** Utilize Moshi for efficient JSON parsing, ensuring seamless communication with APIs.
- **Clean Architecture:** The project follows a clean and modular architecture, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Modularization**: The application employs a modularization approach to divide the project into separate modules, such as domain, presentation, and data. Each module has clear responsibilities and can be developed independently.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The MVVM architecture is utilized to separate the business logic from the view. The Model represents data and business rules, the View is the user-visible interface, and the ViewModel is responsible for preparing and delivering data to the View.
- **Dependency Injection:** Employing dependency injection enhances the app's maintainability and testability by decoupling components and facilitating easier component replacement and testing.
- **Implements MVVM architecture for clean and organized code.**
